                <p>
                    It might be hard for modern day chicken ladies and lads to believe,
                    but there was a time when people weren't as crazy for chickens as we
                    are today! YES! In fact, prior to the 1800s, chickens were seen as
                    part of the farming landscape, existing to provide eggs and Sunday
                    dinner and not much else. Definitely not the adored and spoiled
                    backyard girls we raise today! Cochins played a big part in starting
                    the modern day craze of keeping chickens and their friendly nature and
                    unique looks still inspire chicken keepers today.

                <h2>Leghorn</h2>
                <p>
                    Leghorn chickens are adventurous, spirited, friendly and wondrous
                    egg-layers. First developed in Livorno (Italian for “Leghorn”) in
                    Tuscany and brought to Britain in the late 1800s, they became a
                    popular purebred chicken in America and later Australia. The Leghorn
                    chickens’ egg laying prowess, savvy attitudes and bold personalities
                    made them the most common purebred fowl in Australia in the early to
                    mid 1900s. We love Leghorn chickens, and not just for their ability to
                    lay generously sized, bright white eggs on a regular basis.

                <h2>ISA Brown</h2>
                <p>
                    The ISA Brown is a humble chook. The name ISA Brown is not actually a
                    breed name, but a copyrighted brand name. The breed was developed and
                    patented by a French company in 1978 for optimum egg production and
                    since then their popularity has grown to great heights. They are a
                    well-known choice for backyard chicken coop keepers and farmers alike,
                    and these gorgeous girls are a renowned favourite for a bunch of
                    reasons. We love the ISA Brown for her gentle nature, her resilience
                    and her egg-straordinary egg laying talents that leave all other hens
                    in the dust-bath!

                <h2>Plymouth Rock</h2>
                <p>
                    The Plymouth Rock chicken is a wonderful breed of chook for first time
                    keepers and seasoned Chicken Ladies and Lads alike. They are relaxed,
                    resplendent and responsive and make any coop a more loving and fun
                    place to be. Introduced in the late 1900s, the breed was named after
                    the town of its origin and quickly rose in popularity across America
                    due to their egg-cellent egg laying skills and their laid back look on
                    life. Plymouth Rock hens make great additions to backyard chicken
                    coops and our egg-sperts just love their chilled out vibe and
                    kid-friendly nature.

                <p>
                    The Dutch bred barnevelder breed has to be one of the most popular,
                    distinctive and attractive types of backyard chickens in Australia.
                    Though breeds like ISA Browns, Australorps and Orpingtons are of
                    course intensely popular due to their high egg yield, barnevelders are
                    still a standout breed due to its unique plumage, quirky personality
                    and of course those pretty and peculiar eggs that they lay. But, for
                    most Chicken Ladies, it will be love at first sight when they see the
                    iridescent green tinge in the feathers of a barnevelder chook.

                <p>
                    Aussie, Aussie, Aussie – cluck, cluck, cluck! That’s the response
                    you’ll get if you have a coop full of frisky, friendly and fabulous
                    australorps! The locally bred australorps are a favourite in many
                    Australian backyards due to their brilliant black, white or blue
                    plumage, eggceptional egg laying talents and their characteristic
                    happy-go-clucky Aussie attitude. Though we absolutely love chickens
                    from all over the world, from the elegant English orpingtons to the
                    alluring American Rhode Island Reds, there is something special about
                    a homebred lady.

                <h2>Naked Neck</h2>
                <p>
                    Most Chicken Ladies will never forget the first time they their lay
                    eyes upon a distinctive, quirky and downright bizarre naked neck
                    chicken. When animal lovers first see a naked neck chicken most,
                    without meaning to cause offense, say, “what’s wrong with that
                    chicken?” Yes, these girls sure look peculiar, but it’s the way nature
                    made them. Originating from Transylvania, naked neck chickens are
                    famous for having featherless necks, which sort of make them look like
                    turkeys. There has been some rabble that naked necks are in fact a
                    cross between a turkey and a chicken, however this conspiracy theory
                    has long since been debunked by scientists. Naked neck chickens are
                    undeniably different on their own terms, like Cyndi Lauper or Freddy
                    Mercury, which only makes this exceptional breed all the more
                    loveable.

                    Sussex chickens are a brilliant addition to any backyard chicken coop

                <h2>New Hampshire Red</h2>
                <p>
                    The New Hampshire chicken breed is a reliable and robust hen that
                    doesn’t disappoint when it comes to producing delicious eggs or
                    forming wonderful feathered friendships. These girls are gentle and
                    warm, make egg-cellent mums and are quietly beautiful. Think of the
                    New Hampshire chook as the hen-next-door, an unassuming chicken that
                    is definitely more worthy of your attention than her looks let on. The
                    breed was developed in the early 1900s by New Hampshire farmers who
                    wanted to improve on the existing Rhode Island Reds and have a chicken
                    breed to call their very own. The farmers focused on breeding hens
                    that were fast growing, early to lay and hardy in the bitterly cold
                    winters of the north-eastern US state. The resulting delightful bird
                    was officially coined the New Hampshire in 1935

                <h2>Silkie</h2>
                <p>
                    Silkie chickens have a reputation for standing out due to their fluffy
                    and puffy plumage! Some of you may be imagining a brown or black mess
                    of feathers, but silkie chickens have style in spades compared to some
                    of their cousins, like ISA browns and australorps. Silkies may be
                    small in stature, only weighing approximately 1.5 to 2 kilos, but they
                    always leave a big impression because of their discrete resemblance to
                    celebrities like Lady Gaga, Jimmy Hendrix and Vivienne Westwood.
                    Silkie chickens are such a remarkable breed that the great merchant
                    and traveller Marco Polo, after encountering them in China, felt
                    compelled to bring some back to the west with him. What would other
                    visionaries like Albert Einstein, Andy Warhol and Coco Chanel have
                    made of silkie chickens? One can only assume that they would have been
                    humbled by the brilliance of these unique birds.
